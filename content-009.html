                <div class="content-title">Newegg GPU Trade In Program Scammed Me</div>

                <div class="content-text">
                    On November 20th I traded in my used PowerColor 6900XT Ultimate Edition SKU to upgrade the GPU in my
                    PC, assuming that the credit would help significantly towards the total purchase cost of a new GPU
                    purchase from Newegg's Website. I carefully packaged the card in the original PowerColor box that
                    had the serial number/warranty label on the OEM box. After shipping it to them with their label via
                    UPS, they took forever receiving and processing it (after giving me a deadline to send it in by) and
                    just rejected it immediately on the day they received it without any sort of reason given. <br>
                    <br>
                    I reached out to Newegg Support initially but they blocked my email via GMAIL without any explained
                    reason, so I had to contact a Newegg Support employee through Reddit and they told me to contact
                    someone at another GPU trade in support email address. The Support rep also told me that they
                    checked the GPU trade-in information, and their notes say that the GPU arrived with the warranty
                    seal already broken, which is the reason for denial. However the GPU has never been opened, the
                    original serial number is on the GPU box itself that I sent with the card. Any "warranty seal" is
                    not valid in the United States of America where my residence is. Under consumer law these stickers
                    are unenforceable. Even then, that sticker easily removes off during dust and dirt cleaning since
                    the card is multiple years old now. It seems ridiculous to reject a fully working card that I tested
                    and confirmed working before sending out with the original box and serial information all because of
                    a small sticker covering a screw that has no warranty information at all for it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Today, I just received my GPU back from Newegg in the mail and they did a terrible job sending it
                    back to me as well. Newegg sent it back to me in worse condition. Not only is it missing the limited
                    edition original box that adds value to the card, but they also lost the serial and warranty label
                    that was on the box itself and only got a partial GPU stand. I just got a generic black box poorly
                    packaged with dust on the anti static bag instead of my OEM box with my warranty/serial
                    information... The email address the Support rep also told me to email about the GPU trade in
                    support has yet to respond to my inquiry to this day, it's like they ghosted me entirely. It's like
                    they didn't even test the card! They just scammed me and sent it back without any proper customer
                    feedback. <br>
                    <br>
                    I have been a Newegg customer for over 15 years (16 years since 2025 is approaching) and lately I
                    have been having issues one after another with Newegg with no real resolution in sight. First it was
                    selling me a fake SSD that had positive reviews from their "AI reviews" that corrupted my own
                    personal data, now you're also rejecting my personal working GPU and sending it back worse than I
                    sent it all because you didn't check the OEM box? Gamers Nexus on Youtube warned others about Newegg
                    being shady and the trade-in program being ridiculous but its even worse than I imagined. To sum it
                    up, I got scammed. Newegg made it seem the GPU trade in program is painless and easy especially when
                    trading in to purchase a new GPU from their website to receive credit, but I not only got rejected
                    with no credit but also they returned the product in a even worse state. So I LOST money with the
                    GPU Trade In Program, I did not gain a single penny. It's been a total net negative experience for
                    my wallet and as more than decade Newegg customer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Unless Newegg can resolve this, this GPU trade in program is one big scam from pricing to process
                    and buyer's need to beware. <br>

                        Yup. They got bought out by Liaison Interactive in 2016 and merged with Lianlou Smart Limited in
                        2020. Wikipedia lists their parent company as Hangzhou New Century Information Technology Co.,
